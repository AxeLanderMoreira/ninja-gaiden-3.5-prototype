# Ninja Gaiden 3Â½ Prototype

Prototype Remake of NES' Ninja Gaiden III using HTML5 (Phaser 3 + TypeScript)

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and non-commercial purposes only*. It includes assets from the original game developed by TECMO in 1991.

Initially, it does not aim to recreate the entire game, but I intend to complete at least all of Act II, all the way up to the Boss Battle.

This project utilizes Phaser 3 Game Engine, which works as an abstraction layer for graphics, sound and input, and make a game that relies only on HTML5 standard technologies.

\* _"Educational purposes" meaning: teach myself some TypeScript, and how to write a side-scrolling platformer with local multiplayer._

## Pending bugfixes

* [Gameplay] Quicksand does no damage to players, and if player sinks all the way, it will fall out of game world's edge.
* [Graphics] When using WebGL renderer, some browsers may present "tile bleeding" (a sort of flickering) in the level's tiles. This is discusssed in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62936847/how-do-i-stop-my-tiles-from-bleeding-when-using-a-tilemap-in-phaser-3
* [Touchscreen] Improve the on-screen button to go to full screen; it is clumsy and requires too many touches (tested on an Android phone).
* [Gameplay] Ninja will jump and slash repeatedly if you hold down the respective action buttons. Improve to properly detect and handle button presses.
* [Gameplay] Ninja will not be knocked back if colliding with an enemy while on the ground, only in the air.
* [Co-Op] Smoother camera movement when of the players is KO'ed.
* [Code] Improve resource management: Review objects and scenes' lifecycles and profile memory usage.
